The goal of this repo is to share, remember and eventually maybe reconstruct code for my stochasticity chapter that arose from the pre-MMED workshops

The [last available draft version of the chapter](outputs/chapter.pdf) has been recompiled here.

The book is:

[DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 75. ](http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/Volumes/Vol75.html)
_Modeling Paradigms and Analysis of Disease Trasmission Models_, Abba B. Gumel and Suzanne Lenhart (eds.)
